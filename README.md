SE450 Programming Project —— Logistics Application

Logistics: The process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, effective flow and storage of goods from thepoint of origin to a destinationfor the purpose of conforming to customer requirements.

Our application will process orders to moveitems (products) from one (or more) facilities to a destination facility.These items must be processed at the sourcefacility (retrieved from stock, packaged, packed into containers).

The containered items are then loaded onto transport trucks.These trucks then transport the ordered itemsover approved shipping routes.The ordered items are unloaded, unpacked and delivered to their destination facility.

Our project is to develop an application that will perform these Order Processing & Logistics functions –it will automatically processcustomer orders –a very time-intensive process when donemanually.
